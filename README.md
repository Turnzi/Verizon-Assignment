Built the project using ReactJS , Javascript , Webpack , Babel , Material UI

<b>1. User Input Validation
Add functionality to our “Let us send you our newsletter” module which will validate user input email address and message the user appropriately on valid or invalid inputs.</b>

Added additional functionality that either allows the user to enter their own personal email ( .gmail , .hotmail etc ) or their .aol email.
If they choose the aol option , the email must end in .aol.com

<b>2. Expose Browser Information
Implement a modal dialog which displays any information that is available to a developer on the client (e.g. cookies, browser info, etc). List the information in a human readable, user-friendly format. Clicking on the “Display Browser Information” button should invoke this modal.</b>

wasnt 100% sure what was expected from this in terms on the data wanted to be displayed but added what i felt might be useful 


<b>3. Image Module Implementation
Build an image module in the placeholder provided.
The image and text should be based on the data returned from the following API call: http://myjson.com/152ni8 

Overlay headline text (“title_a”) and summary (“summary”) (truncate to 50 characters) and make it visually appealing. Use the first element returned in the response.

For extra points, build a slideshow (carousel) instead of a static image module using the rest of the elements of the same API.</b>

For here i created a nice slideshow all the data retrieved from the API .
Also added the abiltiy to read more or read less for the summary data
